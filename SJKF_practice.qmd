```{r}
# Question: I want to know how big the home range of an individual San Joaquin kit fox might be given its weight and gender. 

#Question 2: I also want to know which fox has the biggest home range so that we can release it in an area big enough. 

#To answer my questions, I decided to create a function basesd off of the minimum home range size for an average San Joaquin Kit Fox, an endangered species that can be found in the Carrizo Plain. 



# Here is the function I created, which is also saved as a separate R file. 

#' San Joaquin Kit Fox weights and home ranges (an almost correct function)
#'
#' @param W is weight of the fox in pounds. 
#' @param G is gender of the fox. The only options are: 1 for female, 2 for male
#' @param HR_minimum is the minimum home range size of the fox in meters, in this case always 1000. #
#' @returns HR_indiv  The home range for the individual in meters. 


SJKF_range=function(W,G,HR_minimum=1000,HR_indiv) {

  if(W<0) W=NA # Weight should not be less than zero
  
  # Using ifelse() to set NA for values that are not 1 or 2, because we can only have 1 and 2 to specify the genders of the animals. 
  G <-ifelse(G != 1 & G != 2, NA, G)

  #    return("Home range cannot be less than 0")
  if (HR_minimum < 0) return("Home range cannot be less than 0")

  # Calculate the home range of the individual SJKF 
   result <- (W * G) + HR_minimum

return(result)
}


 I have this function saved as  # SJKF_func.R #
 
# I will bring in the function now

source("C:/Users/jcope/OneDrive/Desktop/UCSB/R/SJKF_func.R")
 
  #Now I want to try adding data for 3 different foxes that I have collared in the Carrizo Plain. 
 
# I have one male that weighed 5 pounds (named Scoundrel), one female that weighed 7 (named Betsy) and one male that weighed 15 (named HRM King Rupert the 3rd). 
 
# I will put in this information one individual at a time: 
#Let's look at Scoundrel's home range first

SJKF_range(G=2, W=5)


#This should hopefully spit out a result of 1010 meters
 
 Now I can try my other two foxes...
# Betsy

SJKF_range(G=1, W=7)

#This should hopefully give a result of 1007


# HRM King Rupert the 3rd

SJKF_range(G=2, W=15)

# Hopefully should give an result of 1030 meters. 
 King Rupert therefore has the biggest home range size, and will need to be released in a larger area than the other two foxes. 
 
 
#Let's test the function

SJKF_range(G=1, W=-1)

#If my fox weighs -1, which would clearly be a data collection error in the field, my function should return an NA.
